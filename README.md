Use at least three different data collections within the database (such as users, posts, or comments).
Utilize reasonable data modeling practices.
Create GET routes for all data that should be exposed to the client, using appropriate query commands to retrieve the data from the database.
Create POST routes for data, as appropriate, using appropriate insertion commands to add data to the database. At least one data collection should allow for client creation via a POST request.
Create PATCH or PUT routes for data, as appropriate, using appropriate update commands to change data in the database. At least one data collection should allow for client manipulation via a PATCH or PUT request.
